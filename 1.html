        HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</a> is one of the 
        most basic components of the web, and the meaning 
        and structure of the web content.It is used to 
        define.Other techniques other than HTML are commonly
         used to describe the appearance/expression (CSS) 
         or function/action (JavaScript) of a <strong>webpage.</strong>
        Hypertext refers to a link that links a web page 
        to another page.Links are a fundamental attribute 
        of the web.By posting materials on the Internet and 
        linking them to pages created by others, you can 
        become an active part of the world-wide web world.
